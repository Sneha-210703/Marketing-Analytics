## Key Findings and Insights

### Conversion Performance
- Conversion rates fluctuated throughout the year, with the lowest at 4.3% in May and the highest at 18.5% in January
- December showed a recovery with a conversion rate of 10.2%
- Seasonal products demonstrated significantly higher conversion rates

### Customer Engagement

### Customer Feedback and Sentiment
- Average customer rating remained stable at 3.7, below the target of 4.0
- Majority of reviews were 4-star and 5-star ratings
- Sentiment analysis showed predominantly positive sentiment with scope for improvement in mixed reviews

## Content Performance Insights
